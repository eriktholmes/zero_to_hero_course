# XOR Classification

A second experiment (non-linear) for the micrograd build

---

## Things that this one forced me to do/think about:
  - **Altering activation functions in hidden/output layers**.
      - Updated the neural net to accept activation inputs for hidden layers and a separate activation for output layers (tanh, sigmoid, relu, leaky_relu, None=> linear activation)
  - **Visualizing training behavior** using contour plots with matplotlib:
    - Since the input is 2D we can visualize 'decision surfaces' as training progressed
    - Created two gifs to show how these decision boundaries evolved over time.

## Visualizations
  -  pink/yellow ('spring') contour plot for a single hidden layer (2 neurons). We can see some learning taking place! The second, involves 2 hidden layers or 8 and 4 neurons respectively. This gets a little closer to a 'checker board' that we might hope for but training seemed to be finicky...
      - **simple model**: a single hidden layer of **2** neurons and **750** epochs:

      - **bigger model**: two hidden layers of **8** and **4** neurons respectively and **1200** epochs:

## Okay... what do the neurons learn??

So I REALLY like the idea of interpretability and want to learn all that I can about it... I am starting SMALL here, and hopefully not nonsensically! Towards interpretability we can visualize what a model 'thinks' neuron by neuron by creating an 'activation map' and then, after some slight tweaks to the nn drawing code from https://gist.github.com/craffel/2d727968c3aaebd10359, output the following diagram. 

  -  **XOR neural activity**:

  - Okay... this is a bit hard to see! Basically, for each neuron we output an activation map that shows how the neuron responds to inputs within the unit square (red spots indicate regions where the neuron is firing most strongly). We generally see **first layer** neurons learning to distinguish corners of the grid (i.e. the XOR inputs), and the **second layer** neurons seems to respond to 'diagonals'. The **output layer** then puts this together to produce the XOR decision surface like we saw above.
